**Welcome back!**

So, what did we learn yesterday? A brief recap:

* The **IPython** Notebook
* **Python**: syntax, variables, functions, etc.

Today's focus will be on **developing more advanced NLTK skills** and using these skills to **investigate our own data**. 

*Any questions or anything before we dive in?*

## Dirty data

Now that we're going beyond nltk example data, we're bond to run into dirty data.

A common part of corpus building is corpus cleaning. Reasons for cleaning include:

1. Not break the code with unexpected input
2. Ensure that searches match as many examples as possible
3. Increasing readability, the accuracy of taggers, stemmers, parsers, etc.

The level of kind of cleaning depends on your data, the aims of your project and where you are in your research. In the case of very clean data (lucky you!), there may be little that needs to be done. With messy data, you may need to go as far as to correct variant spellings (online conversation, very old books).

If you need help with data cleaning, we offer trainings in [OpenRefine](https://github.com/yuandra/2016-02-01-data-acquisition-cleaning/blob/gh-pages/open-refine-01-intro.md)

### Discussion

*What are the characteristics of clean and messy data? Any personal experiences? Discuss with your neighbours.* 

It will be important to bear these characteristics in mind once you start building your own datasets and corpora.

    A MODEST PROPOSAL
    
    For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland, from being a
    burden on their parents or country, and for making them beneficial to
    the publick.
    
    by Dr. Jonathan Swift
    
    
    1729
    
    
    
    It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,
    or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads and
    cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,
    four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for
    an alms. These mothers instead of being able to work for their honest
    livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg
    sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn
    thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
    for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.
    
    I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of
    children in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers,
    and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of
    the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore whoever
    could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these children
    sound and useful members of the common-wealth, would deserve so well of
    the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.
    
    But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
    children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall
    take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of
    parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who demand
    our charity in the streets.
    
    As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years, upon this
    important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of
    our projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their
    computation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be
    supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:
    at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may
    certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of
    begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide for
    them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their parents,
    or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives,
    they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to
    the cloathing of many thousands.
    
    There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will
    prevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of
    women murdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,
    sacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence
    than the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and
    inhuman breast.
    
    The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million
    and a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand
    couple whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty
    thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children, (although
    I apprehend there cannot be so many, under the present distresses of
    the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain an hundred and
    seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand, for those
    women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or disease within
    the year. There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of
    poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How this number
    shall be reared, and provided for? which, as I have already said, under
    the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the
    methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft
    or agriculture; we neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor
    cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing
    till they arrive at six years old; except where they are of towardly
    parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier;
    during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as
    probationers: As I have been informed by a principal gentleman in the
    county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never knew above one or
    two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the kingdom so
    renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.
    
    I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years
    old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they
    will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown
    at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the
    parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been at
    least four times that value.
    
    I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will
    not be liable to the least objection.
    
    I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in
    London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a
    most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,
    baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a
    fricasie, or a ragoust.
    
    I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the
    hundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand
    may be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;
    which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my
    reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a
    circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will
    be sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred thousand
    may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of quality and
    fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to let them
    suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and fat
    for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for
    friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will
    make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will
    be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.
    
    I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12
    pounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28
    pounds.
    
    I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for
    landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem
    to have the best title to the children.
    
    Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful
    in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave
    author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet,
    there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine
    months after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because
    the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,
    and therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening
    the number of Papists among us.
    
    I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which
    list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers)
    to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no
    gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good
    fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of excellent
    nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or his
    own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a good
    landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have eight
    shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces another
    child.
    
    Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may
    flea the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make
    admirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.
    
    As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in
    the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not
    be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and
    dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.
    
    A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues
    I highly esteem, was lately pleased, in discoursing on this matter, to
    offer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this
    kingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the
    want of venison might be well supply'd by the bodies of young lads and
    maidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so great
    a number of both sexes in every country being now ready to starve for
    want of work and service: And these to be disposed of by their parents
    if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due
    deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I
    cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American
    acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was
    generally tough and lean, like that of our school-boys, by continual
    exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not
    answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with
    humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon would
    become breeders themselves: And besides, it is not improbable that some
    scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice, (although
    indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty, which, I
    confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection against any
    project, how well soever intended.
    
    But in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient
    was put into his head by the famous Salmanaazor, a native of the island
    Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago, and in
    conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young person
    happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to persons
    of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body of a
    plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison the
    Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime minister of state, and
    other great mandarins of the court in joints from the gibbet, at four
    hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same use were
    made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one single
    groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear
    at a play-house and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will
    pay for; the kingdom would not be the worse.
    
    Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast
    number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I have
    been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to ease
    the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the least pain
    upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they are every day
    dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and vermin, as fast
    as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young labourers, they
    are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot get work, and
    consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a degree, that if
    at any time they are accidentally hired to common labour, they have not
    strength to perform it, and thus the country and themselves are happily
    delivered from the evils to come.
    
    I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I
    think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and
    many, as well as of the highest importance.
    
    For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the
    number of Papists, with whom we are yearly over-run, being the principal
    breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who
    stay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the
    Pretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many good
    Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than stay at
    home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal curate.
    
    Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,
    which by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their
    landlord's rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a
    thing unknown.
    
    Thirdly, Whereas the maintainance of an hundred thousand children,
    from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than
    ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby
    encreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a
    new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the
    kingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate
    among our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and
    manufacture.
    
    Fourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings
    sterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the
    charge of maintaining them after the first year.
    
    Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns,
    where the vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best
    receipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their
    houses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves
    upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who understands
    how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as expensive as they
    please.
    
    Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise
    nations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and
    penalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards
    their children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the
    poor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual profit
    instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among the
    married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the
    market. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of
    their pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in
    calf, or sow when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick
    them (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.
    
    Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition
    of some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel'd beef: the
    propagation of swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good
    bacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs,
    too frequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or
    magnificence to a well grown, fat yearly child, which roasted whole will
    make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor's feast, or any other publick
    entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being studious of
    brevity.
    
    Supposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant
    customers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry
    meetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that
    Dublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the
    rest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)
    the remaining eighty thousand.
    
    I can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against
    this proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people will
    be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and 'twas
    indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire the
    reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one individual
    Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or, I think,
    ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of other
    expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using
    neither cloaths, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our
    own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and
    instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of
    pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein
    of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our
    country, wherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants
    of Topinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any
    longer like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment
    their city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country
    and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one
    degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of
    honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution
    could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite
    to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness,
    nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing,
    though often and earnestly invited to it.
    
    Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like
    expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will
    ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.
    
    But, as to my self, having been wearied out for many years with offering
    vain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of
    success, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly
    new, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little
    trouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger
    in disobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear
    exportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a
    long continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country, which
    would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.
    
    After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject
    any offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent,
    cheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be
    advanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire
    the author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points.
    First, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and
    raiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly,
    There being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout
    this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would
    leave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are
    beggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers,
    with their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire
    those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold
    to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
    mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness
    to have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe, and
    thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they have
    since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of
    paying rent without money or trade, the want of common sustenance, with
    neither house nor cloaths to cover them from the inclemencies of the
    weather, and the most inevitable prospect of intailing the like, or
    greater miseries, upon their breed for ever.
    
    I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least
    personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having
    no other motive than the publick good of my country, by advancing
    our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and giving some
    pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can propose to
    get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and my wife past
    child-bearing.

    Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
    including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
    because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
    people in all walks of life.
    
    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
    assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
    remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
    and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

    Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
    Literary Archive Foundation
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
    array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
    status with the IRS.
    
    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
    States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
    with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
    SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
    particular state visit http://pglaf.org
    
    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
    approach us with offers to donate.
    
    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
    outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
    
    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
    methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
    To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
    
    
    Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
    works.
    
    Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
    concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
    with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
    Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
    
    
    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
    editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
    unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
    keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
    
    
    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
    
         http://www.gutenberg.org
    
    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
    


The books were were working with yesterday had already had some processing done on them so that we could use NLTK to find features of the language. Remember that Python regards a text file as a single long string of characters. The first thing to do is to start breaking the text up into sentences and words.


```python
from nltk import word_tokenize
text = open('/home/researcher/modest_proposal.txt', "r", encoding='UTF-8').read() 
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens[:100])
```

    ['\ufeffThe', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'EBook', 'of', 'A', 'Modest', 'Proposal', ',', 'by', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'This', 'eBook', 'is', 'for', 'the', 'use', 'of', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'at', 'no', 'cost', 'and', 'with', 'almost', 'no', 'restrictions', 'whatsoever', '.', 'You', 'may', 'copy', 'it', ',', 'give', 'it', 'away', 'or', 're-use', 'it', 'under', 'the', 'terms', 'of', 'the', 'Project', 'Gutenberg', 'License', 'included', 'with', 'this', 'eBook', 'or', 'online', 'at', 'www.gutenberg.org', 'Title', ':', 'A', 'Modest', 'Proposal', 'For', 'preventing', 'the', 'children', 'of', 'poor', 'people', 'in', 'Ireland', ',', 'from', 'being', 'a', 'burden', 'on', 'their', 'parents', 'or', 'country', ',', 'and', 'for', 'making', 'them', 'beneficial', 'to', 'the', 'publick', '-', '1729', 'Author', ':', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'Posting', 'Date', ':']


**Challenge!**

1. Find a .txt file from the Gutenberg Project or elsewhere and upload it to the Jupyter Notebook. 
2. Use the word_tokenize to break up the text data. 
3. Print the first 100 tokens.

Breaking a speech into tokens lets us do the sort of word counting that we were doing yesterday on the speeches. We can do some more interesting linguistic analysis if we use Part of Speech tagging. NLTK has a number of different Part of Speech tags that we could use, but the simplest one is called 'Universal', and we'll use that here.


```python
sentence = "They refuse to permit us the refuse permit"
words = word_tokenize(sentence)
tagged = nltk.pos_tag(words, tagset='universal')
print(tagged)
```

    [('They', u'PRON'), ('refuse', u'VERB'), ('to', u'PRT'), ('permit', u'VERB'), ('us', u'PRON'), ('the', u'DET'), ('refuse', u'NOUN'), ('permit', u'NOUN')]


Part of Speech tagging creates bigrams, that is, it associates the word with its tag in a pair of items that we can see above in brackets.  


```python
tag_fd = nltk.FreqDist(tag for (word, tag) in tagged)
tag_fd.most_common()
```




    [(u'PRON', 2), (u'VERB', 2), (u'NOUN', 2), (u'DET', 1), (u'PRT', 1)]



**Challenge!**

Use Part of Speech tagging to tag the text that we have just tokenised the do the following:
* Find the most common parts of speech
* Find the most common verbs and create a frequency Distribution graph of your result
* Find the 10 most common nouns in the text

*Hint: to find the most common verbs and nouns, you will need to create a list that contains only the verbs or only the nouns from the speech. Use a for loop to create your list. Then create a frequency distribution*


```python
tagged_text = nltk.pos_tag(tokens, tagset = 'universal')
text_fd = nltk.FreqDist(tag for (word, tag) in tagged_text)
text_fd.most_common()
```




    [('NOUN', 1871),
     ('VERB', 1082),
     ('ADP', 905),
     ('.', 846),

     ('CONJ', 314),
     ('ADV', 296),
     ('PRT', 208),
     ('NUM', 129)]




```python
verblist = []
for (word, tag) in tagged_text:
    if tag == 'VERB':
        verblist.append(word)
# Check the length of the list of verbs. 
#If it matches the number of verbs above, you can be fairly sure your loop has worked as expected
print(len(verblist))
verb_fd = nltk.FreqDist(verblist)
print(verb_fd.most_common()[:10])
```

    [('be', 67), ('is', 47), ('are', 41), ('will', 41), ('have', 33), ('can', 29), ('may', 26), ('would', 18), ('being', 17), ('do', 16)]



```python
nounlist = []
for (word, tag) in tagged_text:
    if tag == 'NOUN':
        nounlist.append(word)
print(nounlist[:10])
print(len(nounlist))
noun_fd = nltk.FreqDist(nounlist)
print(noun_fd.most_common()[:10])
```

    ['Project', 'Gutenberg', 'EBook', 'A', 'Modest', 'Proposal', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'eBook', 'use']

**Extension**
There are a few things to note about this result - Project and Gutenberg have been returned as two different, very frequent nouns. Because we're humans, not computers, we know it's likely that they are often occuring together. We could test for bigrams (words that typically occur side by side) to see if this is the case. 

In order to perform this test, we must first convert our list of tokens into and NLTK text. We can then use specific NLTK functions on the text.


```python
print(type(tokens))
nltk_text = nltk.Text(tokens)
print(type(nltk_text))
nltk_text.collocations()
```

### Some linguistics...

*Functional linguistics* is a research area concerned with how *realised language* (lexis and grammar) work to achieve meaningful social functions.

One functional linguistic theory is *Systemic Functional Linguistics*, developed by Michael Halliday (Prof. Emeritus at University of Sydney).

Central to the theory is a division between **experiential meanings** and **interpersonal meanings**.

* Experiential meanings communicate what happened to whom, under what circumstances.
* Interpersonal meanings negotiate identities and role relationships between speakers 

Halliday argues that these two kinds of meaning are realised **simultaneously** through different parts of English grammar.

* Experiential meanings are made through **transitivity choices**.
* Interpersonal meanings are made through **mood choices**


Transitivity choices include fitting together configurations of:

* Participants (*a man, green bikes*)
* Processes (*sleep, has always been, is considering*)
* Circumstances (*on the weekend*, *in Australia*)

Mood features of a language include:

* Mood types (*declarative, interrogative, imperative*)
* Modality (*would, can, might*)
* Lexical density--wordshe number of words per clause, the number of content to non-content words, etc.

Lexical density is usually a good indicator of the general tone of texts. The language of academia, for example, often has a huge number of nouns to verbs. We can approximate an academic tone simply by making nominally dense clauses: 

      The consideration of interest is the potential for a participant of a certain demographic to be in Group A or Group B*.

Notice how not only are there many nouns (*consideration*, *interest*, *potential*, etc.), but that the verbs are very simple (*is*, *to be*).

In comparison, informal speech is characterised by smaller clauses, and thus more verbs.

      A: Did you feel like dropping by?
      B: I thought I did, but now I don't think I want to

Here, we have only a few, simple nouns (*you*, *I*), with more expressive verbs (*feel*, *dropping by*, *think*, *want*)

> **Note**: SFL argues that through *grammatical metaphor*, one linguistic feature can stand in for another. *Would you please shut the door?* is an interrogative, but it functions as a command. *invitation* is a nominalisation of a process, *invite*. We don't have time to deal with these kinds of realisations, unfortunately.

In the context of Fraser's speech, there are nearly twice as many nouns as verbs, and the verbs are generally quite simple ones (parts of To Be and To Have make up about a quarter). This suggests that Fraser's speech, even when giving a radio talk to his electorate, is more towards the formal end of the spectrum. 

## Recap
So far today we have:
* Imported text into NLTK
* Tokenised raw text into words
* Tagged words as parts of speech
* Converted a list into NLTK Text for further analysis

## Stopwords
Yesterday, when we did our frequency counts of the books in the NLTK Library, we noticed that a lot of speace was taken up by little words like 'and' and 'of' and 'the' which don't add a lot to our understanding of text. These are called 'stop words'. It will help our analysis if we exclude them.


```python
fdist1 = nltk.FreqDist(tokens)
fdist1.most_common()[:20]
```




    [(',', 510),
     ('the', 327),
     ('of', 236),

fdist2 = nltk.FreqDist(unstopped)

```

The list we have now is probably more intersting if we wanted to get a sense of the key issues in the text. Note, we're working with a very small sample here. This sort of analysis is much more useful over really big corpora.

*Note: We could have condensed the first two steps into a single line of code that looked like this:*

        unstopped = [word for word in speech if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english') and word.isalpha()]

## Collocation
We've just used collocation to test a hypothesis about the most common nouns in the speech we were investigating. Collocation can be quite a powerful tool for finding features of language.

First, let's look for bigrams in the whole list of tokens:


```python
from nltk.collocations import *

    [(',', 'and'),

     ('Project', 'Gutenberg-tm'),
     ('in', 'the'),
     ('of', 'the'),
     ('the', 'Project'),
     ('to', 'the')]



That doesn't tell us much. Let's try again with 'unstopped' our list of tokens with the punctuation and stopwords removed


```python
from nltk.collocations import *
bigram_measures = nltk.collocations.BigramAssocMeasures()
finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words(unstopped)
sorted(finder.nbest(bigram_measures.raw_freq, 10))
```




    [('archive', 'foundation'),
     ('electronic', 'work'),
     ('electronic', 'works'),
     ('gutenberg', 'literary'),
     ('literary', 'archive'),
     ('project', 'electronic'),
     ('project', 'gutenberg'),
     ('project', 'license'),
     ('terms', 'agreement'),
     ('united', 'states')]



As well as identifying collocations (words that appear near each other), we can also look for n-grams or clusters, which appear immediately adjacent to each other. Repeated N-grams are a good way to get a sense of what a text is about. First, let's see how n-grams are created:


```python
print(sent2)
```

    ['The', 'family', 'of', 'Dashwood', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'settled', 'in', 'Sussex', '.']



```python
from nltk.util import ngrams
trigrams = ngrams(sent2, 3)
for gram in trigrams:
    print(gram)
```

    ('The', 'family', 'of')
    ('family', 'of', 'Dashwood')
    ('of', 'Dashwood', 'had')
    ('Dashwood', 'had', 'long')
    ('had', 'long', 'been')
    ('long', 'been', 'settled')
    ('been', 'settled', 'in')
    ('settled', 'in', 'Sussex')
    ('in', 'Sussex', '.')


There are a lot of trigrams in the sentence, and they don't tell us much. It's when n-grams are repeated that they start to get interesting, but before we write code the code for that we need to have some knowledge of dictionaries...

### Building a dictionaries

We've already worked with strings and lists. Another kind of data structure in Python is a dictionary.
Here is how a simple dictionary works:


```python
# create a dictionary
commonwords = {'the': 4023, 'of': 3809, 'a': 3098}
# search the dictionary for 'of'
commonwords['of']
```




    3809




```python
type(commonwords)
```




    dict



The point of dictionaries is to store a key (the word) and a value (the count). When you ask for the key, you get its value.

Notice that you use curly braces for dictionaries, but square brackets for lists.

### Finding duplicate ngrams


```python
import operator
from collections import Counter
threshold = 2
ng = 3
testtext = tokens

#Create out ngram, convert to a list, 
#run a counter to count the number of entries for each unique list element
raw_grams = ngrams(testtext, ng)
listgrams = list(raw_grams)
counts = Counter(listgrams)
print(len(listgrams), len(counts))
#Create a regular dictionary, this is mostly done so we can ignore Counter values less than threshold
D = {}
for k,v in counts.items():
    if v > threshold:
        D[k] = v
#Here is a way to sort a dictionary, based on the value (key=operator.itemgetter(1))
sorted_x = sorted(D.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
```

    7302 6540



```python
sorted_x
```

This last bit of code is more advanced. Don't worry if you forget what every line means. If you are interested getting more comfortable with Python, come to our [Python]('https://github.com/resbaz/2015-12-14-Python-for-Researchers') course.

# Web scraping using Beautiful Soup

The most important skill for using NLTK in your life as a researchers is going to be working with your own texts. First, let's look at reading in text files directly from the web.

Of course, a lot of the text you're going to want to work with won't be in handy text files already. That's where a Python library called Beautiful Soup comes in.

*Note*: the ! is a way of accessing command line functions from the notebook. We could also do this in the terminal (without the !). 


```python
!sudo pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
from urllib.request import urlopen
```

    Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): BeautifulSoup4 in /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages
    Cleaning up...



```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```


```python
url = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog"
```


```python
raw = urlopen(url).read()
print(type(raw))
print(raw[100:200])
```

    <class 'bytes'>
    b'>Smog - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</title>\n<script>document.documentElement.className = docume'


Beautiful Soup breaks the single long string into its constituent parts, creating an object 'Beautiful Soup'


```python
soup = BeautifulSoup(raw, 'html.parser')
print(type(soup))
```

    <class 'bs4.BeautifulSoup'>



```python
texts = []
for para in soup.find_all('p'):
    text = para.text
    texts.append(text)
print(texts[:10])
```

    ['Smog is a type of air pollutant. The word "smog" was coined in the early 20th century as a portmanteau of the words smoke and fog to refer to smoky fog.[1] The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, ozone, smoke or particulates among others (less visible pollutants include carbon monoxide, CFCs and radioactive sources). Man-made smog is derived from coal emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.', 'Modern smog, as found for example in Los Angeles, is a type of air pollution derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. In certain other cities, such as Delhi, smog severity is often aggravated by stubble burning in neighboring agricultural areas. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground. It is usually highly toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened life or death.', '', '', 'Coinage of the term "smog" is generally attributed to Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, "Fog and Smoke" for a meeting of the Public Health Congress. The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux, "He said it required no science to see that there was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as \'smog.\'"[2] The following day the newspaper stated that "Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog." However, this is predated by a Los Angeles Times article of January 19, 1893, in which the word is attributed to "a witty English writer."', "Coal fires, used to heat individual buildings or in a power-producing plant, can emit significant clouds of smoke that contributes to smog. Air pollution from this source has been reported in England since the Middle Ages.[3] London, in particular, was notorious up through the mid-20th century for its coal-caused smogs, which were nicknamed 'pea-soupers.' Air pollution of this type is still a problem in areas that generate significant smoke from burning coal, as witnessed by the 2013 autumnal smog in Harbin, China, which closed roads, schools, and the airport.", 'Traffic emissions â such as from trucks, buses, and automobiles â also contribute.[4] Airborne by-products from vehicle exhaust systems cause air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities.[5][6][7][8]', 'The major culprits from transportation sources are carbon monoxide (CO),[9][10] nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx),[11][12][13] volatile organic compounds,[10][11] sulfur dioxide,[10] and hydrocarbons.[10] (Hydrocarbons are the main components of petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel.) These molecules react with sunlight, heat, ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapors, ground level ozone, and particles that comprise smog.[10][11]', 'Photochemical smog is the chemical reaction of sunlight, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere, which leaves airborne particles and ground-level ozone.[14] This noxious mixture of air pollutants may include the following:', 'A primary pollutant is an air pollutant emitted directly from a source. A secondary pollutant is not directly emitted as such, but forms when other pollutants (primary pollutants) react in the atmosphere. Examples of a secondary pollutant include ozone, which is formed when hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) combine in the presence of sunlight; nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is formed as nitric oxide (NO) combines with oxygen in the air; and acid rain, which is formed when sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides react with water.[15] All of these harsh chemicals are usually highly reactive and oxidizing. Photochemical smog is therefore considered to be a problem of modern industrialization. It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles.[16] Because it travels with the wind, it can affect sparsely populated areas as well.']
